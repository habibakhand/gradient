    <p><b>Comilla Division </b>The Division will be subdivided into six districts (zilas) and thence into 59 sub-districts (upazilas). The six districts listed below comprise the north-western portion (37.6%) of the present Chittagong Division, while the remaining five districts (zilas) comprise the south-eastern portion (62.4%) being separated by the lower (or Bangladeshi) stretch of the Feni River.        
        Argument for status as Division:
        Comilla is an important District in the country as it is in the middle of the capital city, Dhaka and commercial city Chittagong as well as adjacent to the Capital besides various government and non government offices, organisations are situated in this district. Those are Maynamati Cantonment, Genetic Polytechnic Institute, Jail Road, Comilla. (Govt.) Teachers Training College (Govt.) Public University Of Comilla, Comilla Medical College & Hospital (Govt.). Comilla Cadet College. The Comilla Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education.Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (BARD). Bangladesh Survey Institute (only one in Bangladesh). Maynamati War Cemetery. In fact all these offices, Organisations would not be found all together even in some divisional towns let alone in districts without 7 divisional cities & some other districts,such as Bogra, Chandpur, Jessore. The people of this District have been long time Demanding to upgrade their district into a Division for a long time. Comilla is enriched with its lands Cape as well as a natural resources.</p>
